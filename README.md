# Analysis of Superstore Dataset
## IBM Internship Project for Data Analytics

This project focuses on analyzing the SuperStore dataset, which contains Sales and Profit data from a retail store in the United States. The goal of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the Sample Superstore dataset to gain valuable insights into Sales trends and Profitability of the store and identify areas for improvement. 
## Sales Analysis: 
Analyze sales metrics, trends, and factors influencing sales fluctuations. 
## Profit Analysis: 
Analyze the profit and factors affecting profit of various items in the store. 

The Superstore dataset encompasses a wide range of information, including sales data, customer demographics, product categories, and geographical regions. By leveraging this dataset, our objective is to identify areas for improvement and provide data-driven recommendations to optimize the performance of the store. The purpose of this report is to present our findings and recommendations based on the analysis of this dataset.
